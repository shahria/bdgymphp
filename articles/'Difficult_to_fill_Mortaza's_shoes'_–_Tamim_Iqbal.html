<p>angladesh's new ODI captain Tamim Iqbal has admitted it will be difficult to fill Mashrafe Mortaza's shoes as a leader straight away.</p>
<p>"I am very lucky in the sense I had a very close relationship with him," Iqbal said on Saturday, 14 March. "I have seen many things closely and played together for so many years in many places. So I know at least something that he knows.</p>
<p>"But I will say as much as I can take - it is very difficult to fill his shoes. I hope I will take all the positives, and if I ever need his advice I will definitely take it from him," he added. "I am not an experienced captain. I need some time. It will be very hard to go to his [Mortaza's] level straightaway. I know that well. We have achieved so many things under him."</p>
<p>Mortaza stepped down as the Bangladesh captain earlier this month, after the conclusion of the three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe, which they won 3-0. Iqbal said that his main focus as a leader will be to bring change in the on-field mindset of the team. </p>

<p class="cb-nws-para">"The way we are thinking out on the field, how professional we are - I think my first thing will be to improve in that area. It's not necessary to get the results immediately. But you will definitely see the changes. If we start working harder, if we can minimise the mistakes we are making, then you will get the result. Not immediately but at some point.</p>

<p class="cb-nws-para">"So if I have to take this team forward, then first I will have to improve everything off the field. It is not like we are indisciplined as a team, I think we are one of the most disciplined teams in the world. We can be better. If I can start those things earlier and if it starts reflecting on the field then it will be good," he added.&nbsp;</p>
