<p><strong>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today asked the officials concerned of the government to prepare a list of distressed people for providing assistance so that they can face the tough times evolved over the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, UNB reports.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I ask the officials concerned to prepare a list of distressed people and day-labourers&hellip;we have to think about this section of people&hellip; we have to provide them with food," she said.</p>
<p>The prime minister said this while receiving financial assistance from various public and private organisations for PM's Relief and Welfare Fund and 20,000 pieces of PPE for the treatment of coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>She delivered a speech on the occasion from her official residence Gono Bhaban through a videoconference while Principal Secretary Dr Ahmad Kaikaus received the cheques and the PPE on her behalf at the Prime Minister's Office.</p>
<p>It would not be wise only to restrict those who live hand to mouth from going outside, she said. "Instead, their food and livelihood have to be ensured. We have to arrange protection for those people also."</p>
